# <span style="color:blue">Active Directory Authentication Mechanisms</span>

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It provides various authentication mechanisms to secure access to network resources. This document explores different AD authentication mechanisms, their workings, advantages, limitations, and relevant versions.

## <span style="color: red;">1. NTLM (NT LAN Manager)</span>

### Overview

NTLM is an older authentication protocol used in Windows networks before the introduction of Kerberos in Windows 2000. It is still supported for backward compatibility and is often used in environments where Kerberos is not available.

### Working

NTLM uses a challenge-response mechanism:

- **Client** sends the username to the server.
- **Server** generates a challenge (random number) and sends it to the client.
- **Client** hashes the challenge using the user's password hash and sends the result back to the server.
- **Server** compares the received hash with its own calculated hash. If they match, the user is authenticated.

### Advantages

- **Backward Compatibility:** Supports older systems and applications.
- **No Requirement for AD:** NTLM can function in workgroups without an AD domain.

### Limitations

- **Less Secure:** Vulnerable to various attacks such as pass-the-hash.
- **No Mutual Authentication:** NTLM does not verify the server's identity.

### Potential Attacks☠️

- **Pass-the-Hash (PtH)**: An attacker can capture and reuse the hashed NTLM password to authenticate without knowing the actual password.
- **Relay Attacks**: NTLM hashes can be intercepted and relayed to other services, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Due to the relatively weak cryptographic design of NTLMv1, it is susceptible to brute force attacks to recover the original password.

### Relevant Versions

- NTLMv1 (outdated and insecure)
- NTLMv2 (more secure but still has limitations)

### Tools

- **Mimikatz**: A powerful tool for extracting and using NTLM hashes.
- **Responder**: Used for performing relay attacks by capturing and relaying NTLM authentication requests.

### Prevention Measures

- **Disable NTLM**: Use Kerberos instead of NTLM wherever possible.
- **Enforce SMB Signing**: Enable SMB signing to prevent NTLM relay attacks.
  Limit NTLM Use: Restrict NTLM usage through Group Policies and monitor NTLM traffic.

## <span style="color: red;">2. Kerberos</span>

### Overview

Kerberos is the default authentication protocol in Windows 2000 and later domains. It provides strong security with mutual authentication between client and server.

### Working

Kerberos uses a trusted third-party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which includes the Authentication Server (AS) and the Ticket Granting Server (TGS):

- **AS** issues a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) after verifying the user's credentials.
- **Client** uses the TGT to request service tickets from the TGS.
- **Service tickets** are presented to the target server to gain access to resources.

### Advantages

- **Mutual Authentication:** Both the client and server verify each other's identities.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users authenticate once and access multiple services without re-entering credentials.
- **Strong Security:** Uses symmetric key cryptography and time-stamped tickets.

### Limitations

- **Complex Configuration:** Requires proper time synchronization and can be challenging to set up.
- **Dependency on AD:** Requires a functioning AD environment.

### Potential Attacks☠️

- **Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)**: Attackers can steal and reuse Kerberos tickets (e.g., TGT or service tickets) to gain unauthorized access.
- **Golden Ticket Attack**: Attackers with domain admin privileges can forge TGTs for any user, granting unlimited access.
- **Silver Ticket Attack**: Attackers can forge service tickets to impersonate users for specific services.
- **Kerberoasting**: Attackers extract service account Kerberos tickets and perform offline brute-force attacks to recover passwords.

### Relevant Versions

- Integrated in Windows 2000 and later versions.

### Tools

- **Mimikatz**: Used for extracting Kerberos tickets and performing Pass-the-Ticket and Golden Ticket attacks.
- **Rubeus**: A tool for Kerberos abuse, including ticket extraction and manipulation.

### Prevention Measures

- **Enforce Ticket Expiration**: Regularly expire Kerberos tickets to minimize the window for attack.
- **Monitor for Anomalous** Tickets: Use SIEM tools to detect unusual ticket activity.
- **Use Strong Encryption**: Ensure that Kerberos tickets are encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.
